Description
-----------

JavaScript library that attempts to standardise the API interface provided by the browser (looking at Internet Explorer 6,7,8 mainly).

At the moment this project is still very much at the architectural stage and so I'm currently planning the features I think should be included and how best to implement them.

Update
------

The theory behind the library has changed somewhat into something that will organically grow as time goes on.

I'm going to be adding the types of features to this library that you'll find in other JavaScript frameworks, but it will be with the intention of improving my JavaScript knowledge via the process of 'doing' and building the types of features I usually require but don't need an entire framework for (e.g. jQuery)
